## JupyterLab Tabular Data Editor

### Manipulate your tabular data responsively and effectively within JupyterLab.

JupyterLab Tabular Data Editor provides an interface to edit your data side-by-side with Jupyter notebooks. It speeds up your work and eliminates the frustration of fumbling between different apps just to rename a column or add a row. All you have to do is launch your data files directly in Jupyterlab to edit, move, and sort cells, rows, and columns. This extension unlocks these features for massive datasets both on your computer and online. The release of JupyterLab Tabular Data Editor is the first step towards creating an editing experience that leverages any Jupyter supported language to streamline the data cleaning process.


Up until now, data files (e.g. CSV, TSV, or EXCEL) were read-only in JupyterLab. That meant every time you wanted to clean your data, you were burdened by a separate application or time consuming hand-written code. In addition, navigating through a spreadsheet with hundreds of thousands of rows felt like slogging through quicksand. If your work needed to be done online through your organization’s site, multiple downloads and uploads were required just to get a simple data file updated.  On top of that, massive files were impossible to browse.


Today, you can edit data files within JupyterLab! Navigate through trillions of cells smoothly while inserting, moving, filtering, sorting, and deleting portions of data with one of the most efficient editors available. This extension alleviates complicated workflows and limited capabilities that plague data processing.


Whether it’s on your machine or in the cloud, JupyterLab Tabular Data Editor simplifies the editing process in JupyterLab. Within seconds, anyone from beginners to professionals can easily make changes to their data, manage massive datasets, and edit sensitive files in the cloud, without having to leave JupyterLab.
